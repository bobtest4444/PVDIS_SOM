\subsubsection{Target EndCap Correction}

Scattering from the target aluminum windows contributed
(0.5 $\pm$ 0.1)\% (???) to our detected signal.
This background was measured by 
inserting into the beam an empty
aluminum target cell, similar to the one used to
contain liquid deuterium, and measuring the 
signal in our detector. 
The thickness of the empty target cell walls is about 10 times
that of the walls used in the deuterium cell, in
order to compensate for the radiative
losses in the deuterium cell.  

The correction to our data arises from ... ??? ... explain the
physics here; I guess if it's DIS it's then Aluminum is
not much different from Deuterium ...
