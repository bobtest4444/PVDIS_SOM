\subsubsection{Calibration of The HRS Optics}\label{sec:ana_optics}

To calibrate the transfer matrix for the HRS, a 0.5 mm thick 
tungsten plate with an array of pinholes
is inserted about 1 meter after the target and upstream
of the first quadrupole of the HRS.
The calibrations are dedicated runs at low rates with the
vertical drift chambers (VDCs) turned on.
Using the hole-pattern observed in the HRS focal plane,
a chi-square minimization algorithm is performed to 
determine the matrix elements which transform the
track vector to the location of the sieve slit.
