\subsection{Spectrometers and Detectors}\label{sec:HRS}

The Hall A high resolution spectrometers (HRS) at
Jefferson Lab consist of a pair
of identical spectrometers of QQDQ design,
together with detectors for detecting the 
scattered particles \cite{A-NIM}.
The spectrometer and their standard detector 
package served to select for and to 
measure the kinematics quantities ($x, Q^2$)
while suppressing other backgrounds originating
from the target.

\par
The spectrometers are designed to have a
large acceptance with excellent resolution ($\Delta E / E \sim 10^{-4}$)
and absolute accuracy
in the reconstructed
four--vectors of the events and, 
of less relevance for our experiment,
precise normalization of the cross section.
To measure $Q^2$ with sufficient accuracy
requires good knowledge of the transfer matrix for
the spectrometer to reconstruct events at the
scattering point, as well as
good pointing accuracy for the location of the
spectrometers and precise measurements 
of beam position and angle.
To calibrate the transfer matrix, a 0.5 mm thick 
tungsten plate with an array of pinholes
is inserted in dedicated runs; reconstruction
of the hole pattern determines the matrix.
