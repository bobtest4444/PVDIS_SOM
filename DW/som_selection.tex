\subsection{Data Selection}\label{sec:ana_selection}

Loose requirements were imposed on beam quality,
removing periods of beam intensity, position, or energy
instability, removing about 25\%\ of the total data sample. 
No spin-direction-dependent cuts were applied.
The dominant source of noise due to the beam arose
from fluctuations in the beam current and beam energy.

As explained in detail in \cite{Acha:2006my,Aniol:2005zf,PREX},
the window-to-window differences in the asymmetry from beam jitter were reduced 
by using the correlations to beam position differences from precision
beam position monitors, $\Delta x_i$ by defining a correction $A_{beam} = \sum c_i\Delta x_i$.
The $c_i$ were measured several times each hour
from calibration data where the beam was modulated
using steering coils and an accelerating cavity.
The largest $c_i$ was for 
${}^{208}$Pb and was on the order of 50 ppb/nm.
The spread in the resulting $A_n^{m}=A_{raw}-A_{beam}$ was 
 observed to be dominated by counting statistics.
