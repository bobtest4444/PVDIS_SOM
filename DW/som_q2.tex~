\subsubsection{Reconstruction of $Q^2$ and $x$}\label{sec:ana_q2}

The four-momentum transfer squared is 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:qsq}
Q^2 \hskip 0.05in
= \hskip 0.05in 2 \hskip 0.02in E \hskip 0.02in 
E^{\prime} \hskip 0.02in (1- {\rm cos}(\theta))
\end{equation}
where $E$ is the incident energy, $E^{\prime}$ is the
final momentum or energy of the 
electron ($E^{\prime} \gg m_e$) and
$\theta$ is the scattering angle.  

For the beam energy we used the Tiefenbach energy (need to 
explain this) of ??? GeV
and assumed a 3 MeV (???) average energy loss to the center of the 
target which is applied
this as a correction to the beam energy.  
The error in the beam energy $E$ and $E^{\prime}$ are assumed
conservatively to be 3 MeV based on a history of these measurements
in Hall A.  The most important error is in $\theta$ ...

Perhaps need a table of errors.
